        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " - C++ is an compiled language where source code is transformed into machine code by compiler. WHereas, python is an interpreted code which is executed line by line and the code is executed directly without  a seperate compilation step to convert in to machine code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Python Exception Handling handles errors that occur during the execution of a program. Exception handling allows to respond to the error, instead of crashing the running program. It enables you to catch and manage errors, making your code more robust and user-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " - Finally block in Python ensures that certain code is closed properly afetr the block of code is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        " - Loggigng records the statemnet and flow of your program code or software. It is useful for undestanding and  monitoring and debugging of your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - __del__ method is used to delete variables and objects in pyhton program.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " - impot simply menas to import a module. Whereas from ... import menas to call a specific module from a defined package.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " - We can handle multiple exceptions in python by using multiple except blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " - The with statement in Python is used for handling files and other resources that require proper cleanup, such as closing a file after it is used. It ensures that resources are automatically released, even if an error occurs\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " - Multi-threading happends on one processor, threads shre same memory space and resources within a proces. Whereas multi processing uses cores/ processes, each program execution has its own memory space and resources which are isolated from other process.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - Logging shows how the program behave sover the time. It useful for monitoring and debugging of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - It is by default a prpcss in a process runs on a singl ethread or single threaded process.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - The basic steps in exception handling are Try block, except block, else block and to close the code finally block.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python ?\n",
        " - Memeory management is important in python , as if you say you need to use multi-threads to execute a process. You need to have memory managemnet.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling ?\n",
        " - Function of try block is the execution of the code and except block handles all the ecxecptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work ?\n",
        " - Python's garbage collection system automatically manages memory by reclaiming unused objects. It helps prevent memory leaks by removing objects that are no longer needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n",
        " - The purpose of else block in exception handling to run the code if no exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python ?\n",
        " - The common logging levels in python are: Debug, Info, Warning, Error and Critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python ?\n",
        " - Both os.fork() and the multiprocessing module in Python are used for creating new processes, but they work in different ways and have different use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python ?\n",
        " -  Closing a file is very importannt as it ensures the block of code is properly executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python ?\n",
        " - file.read() Reads the entire file content as a single string if no size is specified. Whereas, file.readline() Reads one line at a time (including the newline character.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for ?\n",
        " - Logging module in python is used for understanding and monitoting a code .\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling ?\n",
        " - The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system, including file handling operations like creating, deleting, renaming, and navigating directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python ?\n",
        " - Currently, Python's memory management is handled by the internal Python memory manager, but there are some security risks: Python developers have no direct control over memory management, even when manipulating object pointers pointing to heap memory blocks. This can lead to unexpected memory access and corruption\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python ?\n",
        " - In Python, you can manually raise an exception using the raise keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        " - it is important to use multithreading in I/O or Input and Output problems, multithreading allows multiple tasks to run concurrently (in parallel) within the same process. This can improve performance, responsiveness, and efficiency in certain types of applications"
